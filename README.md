GRID </br>
Hey i added a little game for you since your an awsome teacher and i know this could get boring.</br>
Your task is find a hidden link.</br>
Heres a hint *"2 buttons must be pressed in the right order, while a grid is on the screen"*</br>
see if you can find it and finish the task.</br>
Also it needs to run on CHROME for it to work.</br>
dont use the inspect tool unless you can't figure it out.</br>
